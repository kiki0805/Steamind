                                Welcome to Steamind! To visualize your own Steam library, please fill in your SteamID in the <b>input field at the top left
                                corner</b>. If you don't have a Steam account or just want to explore the visualization, there are some <b>prefetched SteamIDs</b> you can take a look at.<br><br> At the top right there is a <b>legend</b>. You can filter
                                on game categories by clicking on their <b>corresponding circle in the legend</b>, or by <b>using the filters below the visualization</b>. Above the filters there is a <b>current filters</b> which shows you all the filters
                                you have on right now. You can <b>delete a filter by clicking on it</b><br><br> To <b>reset</b> the visualization and reset all the current filters, you can click on the <b>reset button</b> available at the right side of
                                the filters bar.<br><br> If you wish to
                                <b>take a closer look</b> at some games, you can click on them to show their info below the <b>Game Info</b>. By clicking on them you will <b>lock them in place</b> for easier organization. <b>Click on them again</b> to
                                unlock their positions.<br><br> Those are the basics. Happy exploring!

                    <h2>About</h2>
                    <p>
                        Steamind is a tool for visualizing games from your own Steam library as well as other games from Steam that might suit your interests. It is the final project for the course DH2321 Information Visualization given at KTH Royal Institute of Technology.
                        Initially inpsired by Steam's own recommendation system, we wanted to explore a different way of visualizing the data. By displaying the games that you own, Steamind aims to provide a way for you to gain insight of your own gaming
                        preferences such as which categories you prefer, or help you come to terms with the uncomfortable thruth about your bundle-spending habits. Apart from that, Steamind also visualizes a selected set of other games that you might
                        not own in hopes that you can use the visualizaiton to expand your library with games you might want to play.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The visualization consists of a <b>force-directed graph</b> organized in a <b>hierarchical structure</b> with two levels. Starting at the root node is the user and four branches representing game categories emerges from it. At
                        the last level, we have the leaves which represent the games. The games are organized into these four main categories based on a research article from 2020 by Xiaozhou Li and Boyang Zhang [1].

                    <h2>The Data</h2>
                    <p>
                        The data was retrieved from various sources such as the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/webapi" target="_blank">Steam Web API</a>, and <a href="https://club.steam250.com/app/620" target="_blank">Club 250</a>. Data was
                        also scraped using <b>Scrapy</b> from the
                        <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/" target="_blank">Steam store</a> itself. Ultimately, the database includes around 4000 game entries over 10000 games sold in Steam, and covers the most-played games while the other unrecorded
                        ones are less-played. For each game, <b>nominal, numerical, and categorical</b> data was retrieved. These include names, header images, review ratios, (user's) playtime, popularity, category, tags, etc. All the information are
                        organized into mainly six database models: Game, User, Tag, Genre, Review, Playtime. (<a href="https://gits-15.sys.kth.se/karshi/SteamViz/blob/master/backend/steam_scrapy/db/models.py" target="_blank">More details</a>)
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Since the visualization is dynamic and changes depending on which user ID is currently being used, the data itself also needs to change dynamically. To achieve this, a custom API was created so that the front-end and back-end could communicate more efficiently.
                        This means that the data model consists of a back-end database stored in <b>SQLite</b> and data retrieved in .json-format through the front-end.

                    <h2>Learning Objectives</h2>
                    <p>
                        Working with this project, we have gained a better understanding of the theory of information visualization as well as how it can be put into practice. Following the visualization pipeline, we have learnt how to gather and process data in order to get
                        a workable structure. We have gained experience in the designing process and also gained a deeper knowledge in how to use the <b>D3.js</b> library to implement the visual structures and visual mappings needed
                        for our vision to come true. Furthermore, we had to learn how to combine back-end and front-end to make it all work. This not only improved our overall programming skills, but also our teamwork and time management skills as we
                        had to communicate and collaborate efficiently while taking other courses.
